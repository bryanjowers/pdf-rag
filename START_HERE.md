## üöÄ Quick Start for Claude

When starting a new session, read these documents **in this order**:

### 1. Core Project Documentation (Required)
Read these three documents to understand the project:

1. **[readme.md](readme.md)** - Project overview, architecture, quick start guide
2. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Development standards, workflows, coding practices
3. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Documentation structure and organization

### 2. Current Status (Required)
After reading core docs, check current state:

4. **Git Status** - Run `git status` to see what's changed
5. **Recent Commits** - Run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent work
6. **[docs/planning/sessions/](docs/planning/sessions/)** - Check for recent session notes or pickup docs

### 3. Phase-Specific Context (As Needed)
Depending on the work focus, read relevant deep-dive docs:

- **[docs/planning/phases/PHASE3_READY.md](docs/planning/phases/PHASE3_READY.md)** - Current phase status
- **[docs/technical/SCHEMA_V2.3.0.md](docs/technical/SCHEMA_V2.3.0.md)** - Technical specification
