Jordan Survey, A-348 Panola County, Texas\n\n## COMMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS\n\n## 1. AFFIDAVITS OF USE AND POSSESSION\n\nEarly title to the Subject Property is irregular and contains numerous title defects, including one or more gaps in the chain of title.  Accordingly, we believe you must rely on limitations of title to cure these defects.  Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 16.030 states that if an action for the recovery of real property is barred under the limitations statute, a person having peaceful and adverse possession has full or fee title precluding all claims.  Should you obtain affidavits of use and possession that are acceptable to us, we believe you would be reasonably safe in waiving any requirements arising from early gaps and defects.  You are advised, however, that the status of such title depends on matters of fact proven when the necessity arises.\n\n## Requirement No. 1\n\nSubmit for our review affidavits executed by two or more disinterested and credible people stating in detail the nature and character of the use, occupancy, and possession of the Subject Property for a period of twenty-five years prior to any severance of the mineral estate or for the past twentyfive years if no severance has occurred.  The affidavits should contain full and complete information as to the fences, cross fences, improvements -when built and present state of repair -amount of land used for grazing purposes, and the length of time so used.\n\nIn the event you are unwilling to assume the business risk of relying on title by limitations to cure early title defects, then you must resubmit the matter to us for further comment and requirement.\n\n## 2. SURVEY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY\n\nThe legal descriptions contained in numerous instruments describe the Subject Property by metes and bounds with one or more calls to an object, tree, rock, river bed, landmark, landowner's boundary line, corner, an adjacent survey corner, and/or a boundary line.  We have relied on these descriptions  for  the  purposes  of  this  Opinion.    Additionally,  several  instruments  recite  that  the instrument covers specified acreage.  We have not independently verified that the recited acreage is accurate.\n\nWe note that the legal descriptions provided in Prior Opinion 1 states that the specific tracts are the West Half of a larger tract. However, based on the shapes of these tracts, it does not appear that said tracts would be the West Half of a larger tract but the West 82 acres for Tract 1, the West 74 acres for Tract 2, and the West 14 acres for Tract 3. However, ' West Half' has been used for decades in  describing  these  tracts.  Accordingly,  we  have  not  changed  said  usage.  In  addition,  the  surface ownership in Prior Opinion 1 references 8.264 acres surrounding the Cavin Unit Well No. 5 (API No. 42-365-32355), 8.264 acres surrounding the Werner 'P' Well No. 1 (API No. 42 -365-00543), and 8.264 acres surrounding the Werner 'P' Tank Battery but does not provide a metes and bounds for these 8.264-acres tracts.\n\n## Requirement No. 2(a)\n\nObtain and submit for our review the conveyance or plat which contains a description of the three 8.264-acre tracts referenced in the surface ownership of Prior Opinion 1.\n\n## ■ FREEMAN MILLS PC\n\nSupplemental Drilling Title Opinion Cavin Unit -Tract Nos. 7, 8, and 9 170.00 acres, Benjamin C. Jordan Survey, A-348 Panola County, Texas\n\n## Requirement No. 2(b)\n\nObtain, file for record, and submit for our review a survey of the Subject Property, including the  8.264  acres  surrounding  the  Cavin  Unit  Well  No.  5  (API  No.  42-365-32355),  8.264  acres surrounding the Werner 'P' Well No. 1 (API No. 42-365-00543), and 8.264 acres surrounding the Werner 'P' Tank Battery , and then contact us for an update to the legal descriptions of the Subject Property. In the event you wish to adjust the West Half language in the descriptions, please contact us.\n\n## 3. RELIANCE ON PRIOR OPINION\n\nThis  Opinion  is  based  in  part  on  your  request  that  we  rely  upon  the  prior  Title  Opinion rendered by attorneys other than those in our law firm, including Prior Opinion 1. While we have no reason to doubt the accuracy of Prior Opinion 1, we accept no responsibility for any errors in or omissions from Prior Opinion 1 rendered by attorneys associated with other law firms.

That Deed does not appear to convey Tract 3.\n\nSubsequently, by Special Warranty Deed dated December 14, 1990, recorded in Volume 872, page 193, Champion International Corporation, successor-in-interest to Southland Paper Mills, Inc. by merger, purports to convey interest in the Subject Property, including interest in Tract 3. For the purposes of this Opinion, we have assumed that Champion International Corporation acquired the requisite interest in Tract 3 by unrecorded conveyance or otherwise.\n\n## Requirement No. 5\n\nSubmit  for  our  examination  a  conveyance  from  Louise  Werner  Saw  Mill  Company  to Champion International Corporation,  or  their  successor-in-interest.  If  no  such  conveyance  exists, obtain a Quitclaim Deed from Louise Werner Saw Mill Company or their successors in interest in which they quitclaim all of their interest in the Subject Property to the present owners of record. The Quitclaim must then be filed of record in Panola County, Texas.\n\n## 6. TRUSTEE OF SABINE ROYALTY TRUST\n\nPrior Opinion 1 indicates InterFirst Bank Dallas, N.A., is the trustee of the Sabine Royalty Trust. However, the website for Sabine Royalty Trust lists Simmons Bank as its current trustee. No documentation has been filed in Panola County, Texas, to indicate a change of trustee, but an online search of FDIC Bank Find indicates that InterFirst Bank Dallas, National Association, closed as of June 6, 1987, and that the current name of its successor is Bank of America, National Association. We have assumed that Simmons Bank is the current trustee and have credited ownership as such.\n\n## Requirement No. 6\n\nObtain, file for record, and submit for our review instruments confirming Simmons Bank is the current trustee of the Sabine Royalty Trust. If such is not possible, you should contact us for a correction to the ownership.\n\n## 7.

BINDING AUTHORITY GENERALLY ASSUMED\n\nIf a person executes an instrument on behalf of an entity, individual, or other party without the proper authorization from the purportedly represented party, then said party may not be bound by the instrument.  Given the difficulty and substantial amount of time required to determine whether every such instrument included in the Materials Examined was executed with proper authorization, we have made the following assumptions:\n\n1. Any instrument executed by a general partner on behalf of a partnership that has been of record for at least ten (10) years was properly authorized by the partnership,  and  the  general  partner  had  complete  authority  to  execute  the instrument on behalf the partnership.\n2. Any instrument executed by an officer, manager, or member on behalf of a limited liability company that has been of record for at least ten (10) years was properly authorized by the company, and the officer, manager, or member had complete authority to execute the instrument on behalf the company.\n3. Any instrument executed by an attorney-in-fact on behalf of another party that has been of record for at least twenty (20) years was properly authorized by written Power of Attorney from said party, and such authorization had not been revoked as of the execution of the instrument.\n4. Any instrument executed by a trustee that has been of record for at least twenty (20) years was properly authorized by the documents  governing the administration  of  the  corresponding  trust,  and  the  trustee  had  complete authority to execute the instrument.\n\nAdditionally,  where  the  Materials  Examined  include  probate  proceedings  with  a  court order that authorized the issuance of Letters Testamentary to a certain executor of a decedent's estate, we have generally assumed for the purposes of this Opinion that Letters Testamentary were issued to that executor even if a copy of said Letters was not provided for our review.\n\n## Requirement No. 13\n\nIf you are unwilling to accept the business risk of our above assumptions, then resubmit the matter to us for further comment and requirement.\n\n## 14. AUTHORITY: BUSINESS ENTITIES\n\nThe Materials Examined include the following instruments that were executed on behalf of a business entity by a representative whose authority is uncertain:\n\n1. Assignment and Conveyance dated effective December 1, 2019, recorded in Volume 2079, page 71, was executed by Michael K.

Hunter,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Pine  Wave  Energy  Partners,  LLC, managing  member of  Pine  Wave  Energy  Partners  Management,  LLC,  sole member of Pine Wave Energy Partners Operating, LLC.\n\nIf a representative executes an instrument on behalf of an entity without authorization from the entity to do so, then the entity may not be bound by the instrument.  To confirm that an act was authorized by the entity, we must review (i) the governing documents of the entity to verify that a particular category of representative was vested with authority to undertake the act, and (ii) evidence that  the  individual  purportedly  acting  as  representative  in  fact  held  the  role  of  said  category  of representative.  For the purposes of this opinion, we have assumed for each above-listed instance that the  representative  was  duly  authorized  to  execute  the  instrument  on  behalf  of  their  purportedly represented entity and had complete authority to bind the entity to the terms of the instrument without joinder of any other representative or party.\n\n## Requirement No. 14\n\nFurnish for our review (i) copies of the governing documents for each of the represented entities listed above, (ii) evidence that the representatives in fact held their purported roles, and (iii) any other evidence that the representatives had the requisite authority to execute the above-referenced instruments  in  their  stated  capacities  on  behalf  of  their  represented  entities.  We  reserve  further comment and requirement.  Alternatively, you may satisfy yourself of the same.\n\n## 15. AUTHORITY OF TRUSTEE\n\nThe Materials Examined include the following instruments that were executed by a trustee on behalf of a trust where the trust instrument was not provided for our review:\n\nTerm Assignment dated effective March 1, 2019, recorded in Volume 2040, page 579, was executed  by  Raymond  S.

In the alternative, satisfy yourselves that each of the above-identified trustees were authorized to convey on behalf of the trusts.\n\n## 16.

Generally, under the strips and gores doctrine, grantees of properties that abut streets acquire fee title to the center of the street subject to an easement for use of the surface; however, there are numerous exceptions to this general rule.  Unless otherwise discussed in this opinion, we express no opinion as to the ownership of the roads, highways and/or streets that abut the Subject Property.\n\n## Requirement No. 19\n\nIn the event you are unwilling to assume the business risk of relying on the presumption that the strips and gores doctrine applies to the various roads that abut the Subject Property, then you must resubmit the matter to us for further comment and requirement.\n\n## ■ FREEMAN MILLS PC\n\nSupplemental Drilling Title Opinion Cavin Unit -Tract Nos. 7, 8, and 9 170.00 acres, Benjamin C.
